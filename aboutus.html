                    <h3>What's covered in these terms</h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can
                    expect from us as you use Lorem Ipsum services, and what we expect from you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These Terms of Service reflect the way Lorem Ipsum’s business works, the laws that apply to our
                    company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result,
                    these Terms of Service help define Lorem Ipsum’s relationship with you as you interact with our
                    services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#expectFromUs">What you can expect from us</a>, which describes how we provide and
                        develop our services

                        <a href="#expectFromYou"> What we expect from you</a>, which establishes certain rules for using
                        our services
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#content"> Content in Lorem Ipsum services</a>, which describes the intellectual
                        property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you,
                        lorem Ipsum, or others
                    </li>
                    <li>

                <p>
                    Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.

                <p>
                    Some of our services include content that belongs to lorem Ipsum — for example, many of the visual
                    illustrations you see in our shop.
                    You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms,
                    but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content.
                    Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our
                    branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations — for
                    example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in
                    lorem Ipsum's catalogue.
                    You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise
                    allowed by law.
                    The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily
                    reflect Lorem Ipsum’s views.

                    By law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if
                    things go wrong. These terms don’t limit or take away any of those rights.
                    For example, if you’re a consumer, then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers
                    under applicable law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level
                    described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the
                    issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific
                    functions of our services, or their reliability,
                    availability, or ability to meet your needs) are (1) described in the section right above,
                    (2) stated in the service-specific additional terms,
                    or (3) provided under applicable laws. We don’t make any other commitments about our services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms
                    don’t limit Lorem Ipsum’s liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent
                    misrepresentation, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.
